I will create a rock paper scissors game using Javascript from scratch.

The rules for the ones who are not familiar with Rock Paper Scissors: 
You start each round by picking between Rock, Paper or Scissors. The CPU will also pick one of the three. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. If you pick the same, it's a tie.
The first between you and the CPU to reach 5 points wins! Goodluck.
